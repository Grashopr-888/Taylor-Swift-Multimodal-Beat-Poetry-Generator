I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'
And I became hypnotized
By freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied
But now, you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A mеssage in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' herе, hopin' it gets to you
These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster
Replayin' your laughter, disaster
'Cause now, you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified, 'cause
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (It gets to you)
You could be the one that I keep, and I (Ah)
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (At)
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
How is it in London? (London)
Where were you while I'm wonderin' (Wonderin')
If I'll ever see you again?
You could be the one that I love, mm-mm
And now I'm standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
'Cause you could be the one that I love (Yeah, yeah)
I could be the one that you dream of (Of)
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (It gets to you)
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (I can't sleep at night)
A message in a bottle is all I can do (Yeah, yeah)
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (Yeah, yeah)
(Love) You could be the one that I love
(Love) You could be the one that I love
(Love) My love
And now I'm standin' here, hopin' this gets to you
